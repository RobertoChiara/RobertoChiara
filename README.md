# 🐸 Roberto Chiara 💻

### 🦎 Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm Roberto, a multifaceted individual passionate about ecological research, full-stack software development, and photography. Currently pursuing a doctoral degree in ecology, I dedicate myself to studying and understanding natural ecosystems, focusing on biodiversity conservation and environmental sustainability of amphibians and reptiles.

Alongside my academic endeavors, I'm studying as a full-stack developer, blending technical skills with creativity to craft innovative software solutions. My versatility allows me to tackle complex challenges on both the front-end and back-end, cultivating design principles and modern technologies.

In addition to research and development, I'm an avid nature photographer. I use photography as a medium to capture the beauty of the natural world, conveying emotions and stories through my images. My artistic sensibility is reflected in my ability to capture unique details and perspectives, creating works that inspire and connect with the audience.

With my commitment to diverse fields, I embody interdisciplinary curiosity, showcasing how varied passions can enrich one another and lead to a deeper appreciation of the world around us.
